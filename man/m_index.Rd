\title{M index}
\usage{
m_index(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{SpatRaster or matrix containing two values: -1 and 1}
}
\value{
A numeric vector
}
\description{
Calculates m index -- a sum of cellâ€™s values
over the entire site divided by the number of cell in the site.
m has a range from -1 (site completely dominated by the -1 values) to
1 (site completely dominated by the 1 values).
}

ts10 = kinetic_ising(r_start, B = -0.3, J = 0.7, updates = 2)
